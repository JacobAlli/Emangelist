You have thoughts in your head that you have said so many times that are not true. These thoughts hereafter will be called 'Shit Sandwiches'  Some examples of these poisonous thoughts are as follows. "I don't deserve love." "If she only knew what I really thought" "Jeez these kids are a burden." "Why is she always on my case?" "Nobody understands me." "Things won't get better." "I am stuck in this job." "What's in it for me?" "Will I ever get ahead?" "Will it feel good?" "What is the least I can do?"<br>

Despair is what separates a man from hope. Hope is what makes a man pursue greater things in all the areas of life where he wants better.<br>

Ordinary men are exceptional when they show up to life prepared to win. {: .big-text} <br>

How do you show up? How do you be exceptional?  That is what this website is for. <br>
